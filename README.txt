# CS3_4Q_Project_Group_8
This interactive webpage allows the user to sign up in order to become an AKAP Kapitan and ultimately contribute to AKAP's advocacy for orphan children.
Homepage:
 First, the user will be met with a minimalistic, introductory homepage. Here, we have a navigation bar and a footer which contains all of AKAP's socials(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and  
 Email); The user may click on the images to be redirected to the choosen social of AKAP. In this page there is a "Sign Up" button that is to be clicked by the user so he/she can fill in 
 the following form details.
Sign Up:
 Once the user has clicked the button from the home page, he/she will be redirected to a sign up page. The user then must fill up the fields of the said form; However, the user may choose 
 to fill up only the REQUIRED fields, and that is also acceptable. On the right side of the sign-up form are three buttons; "Go back", which redirects the user back to the homepage,   
 "Clear", which will erase the user's current data in the form when clicked, and "Submit", which will save the user's form data and redirect him/her to our next page.
Welcome:
 After the user signs up, a welcome page which display's certain inputs of the user into the form on the previous page will pop up. This page of our website is to acknowledge that the user 
 has finally become part of the AKAP Kapitans. Yet again, there is another button on the right side of the page named "See More". The user is opt to click this button.
About AKAP:
 Finally, the user makes it to the last page of our website. This page contains the basic introductory information of AKAP, including the advocacy's mission and objectives along with a few 
 memorable pictures of the members in AKAP.

Extra Note/s:
- The Sign Up page is the only page with a button that will redirect the user to the previous page. Should the user want to go back to the previous page starting from the welcome page or the "About AKAP" page, he/she will have to click the "go back" arrow on the top left of the tab's screen.
